        <h1>How to use this website</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Give this website access to your camera</li>
            <li>Ensure that the box in the camera display is green. Both of your eyes need to be within this box</li>
            <li>Click the center of the screen a few times and click a few times in the corner where the minimap is for your game. Make sure you're looking where you're clicking</li>
            <li>Input how often you're trying to look at the minimap in the "Check every # seconds" field (in seconds)</li>
            <li>Press the Start button once you start a game to start tracking, and then alt-tab back into the game</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>For best results</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Put the browser in full screen (F11 on most browsers)</li>
            <li>When calibrating the system it's best to only click on corner where the minimap is for your game, the center of the screen, and bottom or upper middle portion of the screen [clicking this area helps reduce false positives. Click on the upper
                center if you're using top left or right, and click on the bottom center if you're using the bottom left or right]
            </li>
            <li>Try not to move your head too much</li>
            <li>Try keep your eyes open the same amount as you play your game</li>
            <li>Use this website on the same screen/display that the game is going to be displayed on</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Some additional information</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The red dot that appears is where the system thinks your eye is</li>
            <li>This will probably only work on a 1080p resolution display, if anyone wants to help adjust for 4k please submit a pull request.</li>
            <li>I've only tested and verified functionality of this website on Google Chrome.</li>
            <li>If using a bottom left / bottom right minimap it has a chance to have false positives if you blink see #2 in "For best results" to help reduce this</li>
            <li>I'm unsure how Webgazer gets your eye line. From short tests it does not appear to send data anywhere, but please use caution. If anyone wants to sort through the 80,000 lines of their code please let me know how it works too.</li>
            <li>This idea was based off of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDBj2dzF5oY">this feardragon64 video</a></li>
        </ol>
